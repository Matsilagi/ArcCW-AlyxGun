att.Description = [[A magazine extension in simplistic terms, but not in the way one would expect.

Newly inserted magazines have their rounds transferred into the reservoir. When the current magazine becomes empty, the stored rounds are loaded into the chamber from the reservoir.
This requires the operator to reload twice to reach maximum capacity.]]
